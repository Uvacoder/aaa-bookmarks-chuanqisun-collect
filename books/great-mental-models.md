# The Great Mental Models Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts

by Shane Parrish and Rhiannon Beaubien

Flaws that lead to a misunderstood reality
1. Perspective. If we are in the system, we can see it. Need outside perspective
2. Ego. We don't seek feedback, or reject them to protect ego.
3. Distance. If disconnected from the results of decision, we won't update our model.

On map
1. Map is an abstraction of relatity. It is not the reality.
2. The cartographer may affect the map. Consider his agenda.
3. The map may shape relatity through shaping the expectation of relatity.
